# Sprint 1 Plan

Kahzum Logistical App, October 13th, 2020

### **Sprint ends on October 28th, 2020**

## Goal

- Create the small business owner interface and research the routing script for drivers.

## Tasks for this sprint:

- As a small business owner I want to be able to easily let Kahzum know I have orders so that they can send a driver to pick stuff up. - Medium - 13

  - Determine UI Framework and install it

  - Build a simple frontend with router logic to show custom information to business owners based on account

  - Setup backend to communicate with DB

  - Setup Oauth for google login

  - Get the site hosted and the server up and running

- As a driver I want to be routed to every destination I need to go so there is no confusion/ambiguity in where I need to go or the best way to get there. - Medium - 20

  - Setup Oauth for google login

  - Routing to determine if driver or business and show different pages

  - Simple driver ui to display addresses entered (for now, mainly just hooking up frontend and backend again)

  - Look at current routing software and openrouteservice api

- Misc tasks that donâ€™t have a story but need to be a part of this sprint to get the ball rolling

  - Research into twilio and how to use that api

  - Build wireframes to help define user flow
